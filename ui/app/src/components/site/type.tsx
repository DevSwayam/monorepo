/**
 * The type scale, as components.
 *
 * The scale itself lives in globals.css as `--text-display` through
 * `--text-kicker`, each step carrying its own size, line height, tracking and
 * weight. These are the handles on it. Edit the two together.
 *
 * Why components rather than just the `text-*` utilities they wrap: a step is
 * never only a size. Every heading on the page also wanted a colour, and every
 * caption wanted a different one, so call sites were spelling out
 * `text-body text-fg-muted` or `font-mono text-fg-subtle text-kicker` by hand.
 * Those strings drifted. `text-caption` was being used in two places and
 * defined in none, a heading was tracked by hand to cancel out a family that
 * is no longer there, and the same grey was spelled three ways on text doing
 * one job.
 *
 * So the pairing is the thing worth naming. `<Body tone="muted">` is one
 * decision with one place to change it; `text-body text-fg-muted` is two
 * decisions that happen to agree today.
 *
 * Sizes are not overridable through a prop on purpose. A step is a step: if a
 * design needs something between title and body, that is a new step in the
 * scale, declared in globals.css and registered in the tailwind-merge config
 * in `lib/utils.ts`, not a one-off `text-[15px]` at a call site. Passing
 * `className` still works for layout, margins and the odd deliberate
 * exception.
 */

/**
 * The colour roles text may take.
 *
 * A closed set rather than free `text-*` classes, because the greys are the
