 * Candles, drawn the one way.

 * Every chart on the page (the drawable one in the hero, the worked example,
 * the redraw walkthrough) had its own copy of this loop, and they had already
 * drifted: different minimum body heights, different wick widths, the same
 * colour expression written six times. A candle should look like a candle
 * everywhere, so there is one of these now and the callers supply only what
 * genuinely differs: where bar `i` sits, how wide its body is, and how far
 * back it should sit.
 *
 * `x` is a function rather than a step, because the forecast half of a chart
 * spaces its bars differently from the history half.
