 * first guess and it was too mean — on a near-black card against a near-black
 * ground, a 50px sliver reads as a vertical smudge rather than as a card with
 * more content on it.
 *
 * `cqw` rather than `%`. A percentage translate resolves against the element
 * being moved, and the element being moved is the track, whose width is the
 * slide count times this — so the arithmetic would silently change every time a
 * caller added a slide. Container units resolve against the viewport, which is
 * the box a slide is being centred in, so the sum below holds for three slides
 * or thirty.

 * The dark stepped card, as a carousel you can see the sides of.

 * It used to render only the active slide, replaying its contents in place.
 * That reads as one panel redrawing itself: nothing on screen said more panels
 * existed, so the dots carried that alone and a reader who did not look at them
 * had no reason to wait. Showing the edges of the neighbours and sliding
 * between them makes the set obvious without a word of copy, and gives the
 * movement a direction, which a fade does not have.
 *
 * Every slide is mounted, not just the active one, which is the cost of the
 * peek. Callers whose slides are expensive to draw should memoise them — see
 * the note in scenario-panel.tsx, where three live charts would otherwise
 * re-render on every frame of one animating chart.
 *
 * Advancing is still the caller's business. One of them runs a plain interval,
 * the other a frame clock tied to a chart, and pushing either into here would
 * mean a timer that has to know about both.
