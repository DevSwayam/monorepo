/**
 * tailwind-merge has to be told about our custom type scale.
 *
 * Out of the box it classifies an unknown `text-*` as a colour, so `text-heading`
 * and `text-foreground` in the same call look like a conflict and the size gets
 * dropped, section headlines silently render at body size. Registering the
 * scale as font sizes keeps both.
 *
 * Every step in the scale belongs in this list. A step defined in globals.css
 * but missing here is worse than one that does not exist, because it works
 * until someone passes a colour alongside it and then silently loses its size.
